# NORDLE

![A partially completed game of Nordle with two incorrect guesses](./assets/nordle-screenshot.png)

Nordle is a Wordle re-creation with a Norse mythology-inspired theme. The objective of the game is to guess the secret 5-letter word in as few tries as possible. To play, simply type out your 5-letter guess word. Note that the word must be a valid English word. To submit your guess, either hit the Submit Guess button or press Enter. 

The correctness of your guess will be revealed by the resulting color of each letter. A green letter indicates that the letter is in the secret word and is in the correct position; a yellow letter indicates that the letter is in the word, but is in the incorrect position; a black letter indicates either that the letter is not in the word, or that there are no more of that letter in the word.  

Try to win 10 games in a row to become a Rune Master!
